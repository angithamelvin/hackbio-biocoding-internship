HackBio Biocoding Internship - Stage 1
This repository contains the solutions for the first stage tasks of the HackBio Biocoding Internship. The tasks focus on bioinformatics and programming in Python. The following functionalities have been implemented:

Tasks Completed
1. Translate DNA to Protein
This task involves translating a given DNA sequence into a corresponding protein sequence using a predefined codon table. The function splits the DNA sequence into codons, then maps each codon to its corresponding amino acid.

2. Simulate Logistic Population Growth
This task simulates a logistic population growth curve. The function models the population growth over time using the logistic growth equation, with parameters that influence the growth rate and carrying capacity.

3. Time to Reach 80% of the Maximum Growth
This task calculates the time required for a population to reach 80% of its carrying capacity using the logistic growth model. The time is computed based on the carrying capacity and the growth rate.

4. Hamming Distance Calculation
This task calculates the Hamming distance between two strings (e.g., Slack username and Twitter/X handle). The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters in the strings are different. The function compares the two strings after padding the shorter one with underscores to make them the same length.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
math (for mathematical functions)
seaborn (for plotting the logistic growth curve)
