# Population Growth Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of logistic population growth curves using Python. The model generates random growth curves, each representing the different phases of population growth: lag, exponential, and logistic phases.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `math`
- `random`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
